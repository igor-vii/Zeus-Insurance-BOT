/**
 * Many providers (Groq, Together, ...) ship a Stainless-generated SDK that mirrors the classic `openai`
 * file layout: `resources/chat/completions.{js,mjs}` (class `Completions`) and
 * `resources/embeddings.{js,mjs}` (class `Embeddings`), each with a `create(body, options)` that returns
 * a thenable `APIPromise`. Sync tracing preserves its lazy body parsing; Auto would trigger it via `.then()`.
 * A streaming call resolves to the same OpenAI-style async-iterable `Stream` the openai integration consumes. These
 * SDKs ship dual CJS/ESM and the matcher compares `filePath` exactly, hence one entry per built file.
 *
 * Because the wire format is OpenAI-compatible, the span building, streaming and response parsing are all
 * reused from `ai/openai`; only the module name, channels and `gen_ai.provider.name` differ per provider.
